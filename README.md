# INFO
A full list of plugins I've either had help making or made myself (with the exception of Always Headbutt & TM Auto-Descriptions)!

Of the plugins that can be found here, the Mystery Egg & Story Level System plugins **require new saves** in order to take effect! Anything else when implemented will retroactively work just fine!

## Plugins
- Always Headbutt
> Headbutt usage in the overworld will now always guarantee an encounter.

- Always Double Battles
> Will always force double battles where possible & prevents box usage if the player has 2 or less Pokemon.

- Black Market
> A revision of the original [Black Market plugin](https://eeveeexpo.com/threads/2877/) by JV; allows the player to sell Pokemon ala a traditional Mart with the script command pbBlackmarket. Format is either pbBlackMarket[STOCKLISTNAME] with STOCKLISTNAME replaced with the list in the index at the top OR pbBlackMarket([[:SPECIES,COST,LEVEL]]).

- Customizable Level Caps
> **This is an updated version of Golisopod’s Level Caps plugin.**
> Unlike [NonoNever's version (Level Caps EX)](https://eeveeexpo.com/resources/1481/), it lets you use **both soft and hard level caps** in the same game. This means both can be implemented ingame for whatever you may desire to be used for. The code also includes a **Rare Candy-like item** that stops Pokémon from going over the level cap when used. The original Rare Candy still works the same, so you can include both versions if you want.

- Default Player Names
> A predefined name given to the player character instead of the player's compurer name if they do not enter any name in normally.

- Evolutions in Battle
> Allows level-based or related evolutions to be done in battle.

- Hedgie's Special Item Effects

- Pokedex Icons over Footprints
> Replaces Pokémon footprints in the Pokédex with their corresponding Pokémon icons.

- New Game+
> A Pokemon-based New Game+ plugin that carries over Pokémon (base form at level 5) and money while removing items. Shininess, ability, nature kept, and max IVs set
> Adds "New Game+" to the load screen.
> To use, call at a specific spot with NewGamePlus.prepare.

- Mystery Egg
> **Requires a new save to properly work.**
> Simplifies the scripting and management of mystery eggs where one of several possible Pokémon species is chosen at random once, and then always hatches into that same pre-determined species for that playthrough. This mirrors the system seen in games like Pokémon Reborn or Pokémon Rejuvenation, where the egg is not truly random each time you reset, making it consistent per save.

- Rejuvenation Style Move Relearner
> A system that lets a Pokémon relearn moves from the party menu after a Heart Scale is used on it through the Move Relearner NPC.

- Semi-Shift Mode
> A new battle style based on Clover & Radical Red that allows the player to switch Pokémon without seeing the opponent's next foe.

- Story-based Levels
> **Requires a new save to properly work.**
> The level used in battle is linked to a variable that determines the level at which the Pokémon's stats are calculated.

- SV Forfeiting
> An update to battling that allows the player to forfeit in battle without the need of debug.

- Thieve into Bag
> Stolen items go directly into the Bag instead of being held by the attacking Pokémon when using Covet or Thief.

- TM Auto-Descriptions
> TM move descriptions are automatically generated if the "Description" field in the item's PBS file is left blank (Description =).
